My first attempt at a serious project. I have no clue why but I fancied the idea of creating my own fetch one day when I was a third of the way through a PB & J. Nt sure what else to say....

ToDo()
---
1. Determine what info that will be fetched
2. Get images/ascii art of some clever shit
3. User choices?
